The reasons for the note-deleting bug was:
- In the frontend, it wasn't waiting for the backend's response before deleting 
    the note in the frontend's state. Now, if there is an error, it doesn't delete.
- In the backend, the note wasn't being deleted at all. Now a database delete request
    is made, and it sends an error if the deletion fails.
